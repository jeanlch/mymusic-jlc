# Link to Heroku server
# My issues:
 Heroku does not allow to deploy a repository from github enterprise (used by CU).
 So I imported my git rep to my personal account and deployed it to Heroku.
 The problem is that in my code, I am using Codio's directories to fs.write files or readfiles.
 Heroku has not these directories so an error occurs each time I try to upload a file.
 I should work on the Heroku ressources to be able to work properly with data.
